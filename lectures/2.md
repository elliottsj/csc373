Proof of loop invariant: $$\exists OPT$$ extending $$S_i$$

> Case 1: $$S_{i+1} = S_i$$
>   Then A_{i+1} overlaps with some A_j \in S_i
>   Goal: show that $$\exists OPT', S_{i+1} \subseteq OPT' \land OPT' \subseteq S_{i+1} \cup \{A_{i+1}, \ldots, A_n\}$$
>   Claim: let $$OPT' = OPT$$. 
>   - $$S_{i+1} = S_i \subseteq OPT = OPT'$$ (by I.H.)
>   - $$OPT' = OPT \subseteq S_i \cup \{A_{i+1}, \ldots, A_n\}
>   - $$OPT' = OPT \subseteq S_{i+1} \cup \{A_{i+1}, \ldots, A_n\}
>   
>   In addition, $$A_{i+1} \not \in OPT$$ because:
>   - $$A_{i+1}$$ overlaps with $$S_i$$
>   - $$S_i \subseteq OPT$$
>
> Case 2: $$S_{i+1} = S_i \cup \{A_{i+1}\}
>   Case 2.1: $$A_{i+1} \in OPT$$
>     Then $$OPT$$ extends $$S_{i+1} already$$
>   Case 2.2: $$A_{i+1} \not \in OPT$$
>     Goal: show that $$\exists OPT'$$ extending $$S_{i+1}$$
>     Consider $$OPT \cup \{A_{i+1}\}$$:
>       1. $$A_{i+1}$$ must overlap with some $$A_j \in OPT$$ (else $$OPT$$ is not optimum)
>       2. $$A_{i+1}$$ overlaps with exactly one $$A_j \in OPT$$ where $$j \geq i + 2$$. This implies $$f_{i+1} \leq f_j$$
>   Let $$OPT' = OPT \cup \{A_{i+1}\} - \{A_j\}$$
>     - $$OPT' is a solution$$: we've removed the only overlap in $$OPT \cup \{A_{i+1}\}$$
>     - $$OPT'$$ is optimum: $$|OPT'| = |OPT|$$
>     - $$OPT'$$ extends $$S_{i+1}$$
> Conclusion: every $$S_i$$ is "promising"
> Consider $$S_n$$: by L.I., $$\exists OPT$$ such that $$S_n \subseteq OPT$$ and $$OPT \subseteq S_n \cup \emptyset \implies S_n = OPT$$
