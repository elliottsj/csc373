C. Greedy by *duration*
 - Correctness? No.

D. Greedy by *overlap count*
 - Correctness? No.

E. Greedy by finish time
 - Intuition: free up resources (time) early
 - Correctness? We will prove the algo is correct
 
   > Let S_0, S_1, S_2, ..., S_n by partial solutions constructed by algo.
   > Goal: prove S_i ~~(some selection from A_{i+1}, ..., A_n)~~> Optimum solution

   > Def: for any S_i and any optimum solution OPT
   > OPT *extends* S_i iff
   >  - S_i \subset OPT
   >  - OPT \subset S_i \union \{A_{i+1}, ..., A_n\}
   > Note: OPT not necessarily unique

   > Prove a loop invariant:
   >   "\exists OPT that extends S_i  (where OPT is an optimum solution)"
   >   i.e. "S_i is promising"
   > 
   > ## Proof by induction on i (number of iterations)
   > Base case: S_0 = \empty
   >   Pick any optimum solution OPT: \empty \subset OPT \subset \{A_1, ..., A_n\}
   >   So OPT extends S_0
   > Induction hypothesis: suppose i >= 0 and S_i is promising
   >   i.e. \exists OPT extending S_i
   > Induction step: consider S_{i+1}
   >   Either S_{i+1} = S_i  (A_{i+1} not included in set)
   >   or S_{i+1} = S_i \union \{A_{i+1}\}

### Aside:
 - Easy: writing the algorithm itself
 - Hard: reasoning about _why it works_
