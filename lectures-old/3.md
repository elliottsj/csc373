## Minimum Spanning Trees
Input: $$G = (V, E)$$, undirected, connected, with non-negative integer weights $$w(e) \forall e \in E$$
Output: Spanning tree $$T \subseteq E$$ with minimum total weight

A. Bruteforce: consider every subset of $$E$$
- runtime: $$> 2_m (m = |E|)$$

B. Prim's algorithm
- runtime: $$O(m log n)$$

C. Kruskal's algorithm
- runtime: $$O(m log n)$$

D. Reverse-delete
- start with every edge, remove edges until a spanning tree is left
  1. Start with $$T = E$$
  2. As long as $$T$$ contains some cycle:
    i. let $$C$$ be one such cycle
    ii. remove max-weight edge from C
- runtime: $$\Omega(m^2)$$


### Correctness (for Kruskal's):
Algo:
  1. sort edges so $$w(e_1) \leq \ldots \leq w(e_m)$$
  2. $$T = \emptyset$$
  3. for $$i = 1, 2, \ldots, m:
    i. if endpoints of $$e_i$$ are not connected in $$T$$: $$T = T \cup \{e_i\}$$

- Let $$T_0, T_1, \ldots, T_m$$ denote partial solutions.
- Minimum spanning tree (MST) $$T*$$ extends $$T_I$$ iff:
  * $$T_i \subseteq T* : T*$$ contains every edge selected by algo
  * $$T* \subseteq T_i \cup \{e_{i+1}, \ldots, e_m\} : T*$$ contains none of edges rejected by algo
- Def: $$T_i is _promising_ iff $$\exists MST T*$$ extending $$T_i$$

Prove "$$T_i$$ is promising" is loop invariant by induction on $$i$$:
- Base case: $$T_0 = \emptyset$$: every MST extends $$T_0$$
- Induction hypothesis: Assume $$\exists MST T*$$ extending $$T_i$$ for some $$i \geq 0$$
- To prove: $$T_{i+1}$$ is promising (induction step)
