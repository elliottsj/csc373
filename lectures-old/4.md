- Correctness of Kruskal's algo.
- Proof that "$\exists \text{ MST } T^*$ extending $T_i$" is a loop invariant

*I.S.* Consider $T_{i+1}$
From algo: either $T_{i+1} = T_i$ or $T_{i+1} = T_i \cup \{e_i+1\}$

###### Case 1: If $T_{i+1} = T_i$ (algo "rejects" $e_{i+1}$), then:

(notability)

$e_{i+1} \not \in T^*$ because endpoints of $e_{i+1}$ are connected in $T_i \subseteq T^*$

So $T_{i+1} = T_i \subseteq T^*$ and $T^* \subseteq T_i \cup \{e_{i+1}, \ldots, e_m\}$ and $T^* \subseteq T_{i+1} \cup \{e_{i+1}, \ldots, e_m\}$

Then $T^*$ extends $T_{i+1}$

###### Case 2: If $T_{i+1} = T_i \cup \{e_{i+1}\}$, then:
$e_{i+1} \in T^*$ or $e_{i+1} \not \in T^*$.

_Subcase 2.1_: If $e_{i+1} \in T^*$, then $T^*$ extends $T_{i+1}$

_Subcase 2.2_: If $e_{i+1} \not \in T^*$
To do: construct MST $T^{**}$ that extends $T_{i+1}$
Consider $T^* \cup \{e_{i+1}\}$. It contains a cycle.

(notability)

Consider edges on C: does $T_i$ contain every one of those edges?
No: C must contain some edge $e_j$ for $j > i + 1$

Let $T^{**} = T^* \cup \{e_{i+1}\} - \{e_j\}$: $T^{**}$ is a spanning tree.
$weight(T^{**}) = weight(T^*) + w(e_{i+1}) - w(e_j$
- by ordering f edges, $w(e_j) \geq w(e_{i+1}$
- since $weight(T^*)$ is mimumum, it must be that $w(e_j) = w(e_{i+1})$
- then: $T^{**}$ is a MST and extends $T_{i+1}$

Conclusion: every $T_i$ is promising. In particular, $T_m$ is promising:
$\exists$ MST $T^*$: $T_m \subseteq T^*$ and $T^* \subseteq T_m \cup \{\} \implies T_m = T^* \implies T_m$ is a MST
